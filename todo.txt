# Edition 3.1

+ fix malformed goto code example (nametag being indented)
+ lessen goto discouragement a bit and add an example where it's actually useful
  (cleanup)
  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#centralized-exiting-of-functions

+ clang now complains about strict prototypes in 1/barebones
  change code and see if the book needs adjustments because of that?
  disable -Werror before it is mentioned in the book itself?
  ...wow, i updated clang and apparently it works now.
  I only noticed this because various other snippets before 13 should have been
  flagged too.

+ fix integer comparison of different signedness in good goto example
  Guess which compiler didn't flag this before a recent update!
  On the 22th March of 2024, Clang has officially won the gaslighting award...
  i am actually still not sure if i am just bad.

+ switch: add reminder that you can only use numerical types in a switch

+ add `-fsanitize` to pointer chapter

Also update the copyright.

+ add how booleans are abstractions

+ add c99 array initialization 

+ fix minor writing oddities like misplaced commas, typos, formulations

+ setup: recommend Linux Mint more and reflect that in the text editor part

Also replace weird running from USB bit with just using virtualization bit.

+ promote lazypurple reference to a straight quote

+ fix minor writing oddities like misplaced commas, typos, formulations

- add bit shift to optional end topics?
  (if so, say "Remember that i listed **all** the operators earlier in the
   operators chapter? I lied again... oops. One could almost say that I cut some
   uncomfortable truths to improve the learning experience.
   Anyway, here are the missing operators...")

- nit: maybe the whole schtick of
  "types: ..., void is here but it's only useful later"
  can be solved in a better way?

- look for other fixes
- set edition in cover
