# Explanation of terms

## Compiler

A compiler is a program that turns your written code into something the machine
can understand. It’s like a translator. You and the machine are speaking in
different languages, and the compiler is the metaphoric man in the middle. Once
its work is done, you will be granted an executable file or errors, if something
in the code is not meeting criteria of correctness.  

## Assembly language

Assembly is a human readable representation of the machine language. It is even
closer to the hardware than C is.  
“Then why is this book not focused on assembly then?”  
Because it is too far away from conventional programming languages.
Assembly and programming languages,
especially higher level languages such as Python, look very different.
Learning assembly itself won't help you much,
if your goal is to program in a somewhat conventional way.  

## Syntax

Syntax describes how text and characters convey meaning to a reader. This reader
can also be a program such as the compiler.  
Put simply, in the context of programming: syntax describes where you need to
put what, for your code to be valid. This will soon be visualized to you.  

## Symbols

A symbol is a name given to a part of the program by the developer.  
Variable and function names are symbols.  

# CLI

Command line interface. This is where you give your operating system its
commands, and interact with some programs.
