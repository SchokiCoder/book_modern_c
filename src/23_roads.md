# Roads to Rome

In programming there is rarely one correct way to do it. Different people think
divergent, and can come up with different and valid solutions. In the following
snippet are two functions that reverse a string. The interface and
implementation of these functions differ.  

```c
{{ #include ../code/23/string_reverse.c }}
```

Both are valid solutions to the problem.  
Though you should make sure to use the most simplistic solution whenever
possible. Sure comments help with complex situations, but maintaining a simple
function is easier than maintaining a complex function, regardless of
comments.  
  
Never feel smug because you got a flashy solution.  
As a wise _(and crazy)_ man once said:  
"An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity."
