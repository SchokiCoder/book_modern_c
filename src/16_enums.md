# Enumerators

...allow for a neat organization of names that represent values from the same
type.  

```c
{{ #include ../code/16_enumerators/enum.c }}
```

An enum at it's core is a numerical type. You can assign any constant number to
a member of an enum.  

```c
{{ #include ../code/16_enumerators/enum-vals.h }}
```
