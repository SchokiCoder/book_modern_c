# Arrays

An array is way to hold a lot of variables in one name.  

```c
{{ #include ../code/8_array.c }}
```

When brackets with a number are given next to the variable name in the
declaration, it means the array holds that many units. Since the first element
is addressed by 0, the last element will be addressed with a 3 in this case.  
When accessing a value of an array, see the number in brackets as an offset.
