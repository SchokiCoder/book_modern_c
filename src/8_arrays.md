# Arrays

An array is way to hold a lot of variables in one name.  

```c
{{ #include ../code/8_arrays/array.c }}
```

In line 06 declared and in lines 08 - 11 defined. When a 4 in brackets is given
in the declaration, it means the array holds 4 units. Since the first element is
addressed by 0, the last element will be addressed with a 3 in this case.  
When accessing a value of an array, see the number in brackets as an offset.
