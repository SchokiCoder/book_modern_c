# Setup

First you want to make sure to install Linuxâ€¦ no?  
Look mate, you don't have to commit to it in a way of permanently replacing your
current OS.  
You can run a live-disk from a USB-drive, which would get a bit awkward after
some time, so better install it on that USB-drive. After that just boot from
BIOS into that Linux-USB-drive and done.  
  
If you go out and look for the Linux install software, then i gotta tell you,
that's not how it works. There is not just the one Linux install-disk or
something like that. Rather, there are hundreds, so don't fret over which one to
pick, because i recommend you just use Ubuntu or Linux-Mint. They are good for
beginners, definitively enough for the purposes of this book and are
DEBIAN-BASED:  
<https://linuxmint.com/download.php>  
<https://ubuntu.com/desktop>  
  
Still not? Alright okay. If you are interested in programming, i can only
recommend it though.  
Keep in mind, this book is written mainly for Linux and the "gcc" compiler.  
So the setup phase can be difficult and the reading experience can be
hampered.  

## Compiler

What you need at the very least is a compiler.  

### Linux

On Linux that would be gcc for example, available via your package manager. In
most cases it should already be installed. Try `gcc` in terminal, if the
output is something like:  
`gcc: fatal error: no input files`  
then you have it. If not try the following commands (depending on your operating
system):  

| operating system         | command                |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Debian and Debian-based  | `sudo apt install gcc` |
| Arch and Arch-based:     | `sudo pacman -S gcc`   |
| Fedora and Fedora-based: | `sudo dnf install gcc` |

### Windows

On Windows, i recommend you to get "Cygwin".  
It will provide a Linux like environment, for you to use:  
<https://www.cygwin.com>  
It will also come with the needed compiler or give you the option to patch it
into later.  
  
If not, at least get the compiler "mingw":  
- <https://www.mingw-w64.org>
- <https://nuwen.net/mingw.html>
- <https://www.msys2.org>

## Editor

A **good** editor is the next thing on the list.  

### Linux

Most Linux distros come with a very basic editor already. For example "gedit",
"mousepad" or "kate".  
Find your editor and make sure it has a feature called "syntax highlighting"
and that it is enabled. If you don't have any editor with syntax highlighting,
install one of the aforementioned ones via your package manager or find one on
your own.  

### Windows

On Windows, ditch notepad.exe and get "Notepad++" or "Visual Studio Code" i
guess. I would go with Notepad++ though, if i were glued to a Windows-only PC.  

## Debugger

### Linux

Use "gdb". If you have "gcc" installed out of the box, chances are "gdb" is
already in your party. If not, you know the package-manager-drill.  

### Windows

There is a good chance "gdb" comes packed with "mingw" / "Cygwin" already. If
that is not the case, then get it from the internet. Since you are a grown
adult, that committed to a path, you can also do the heavy lifting.  

## Make

### Linux

Get "make" via package manager, if not already there.  

### Windows

Get "make" via the "Cygwin" packages, if not already there. If you don't use
"Cygwin", then go find it on the internet. Make sure not to accidentally get
"cmake", that is something else.
