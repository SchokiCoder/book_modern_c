# Foreword

This book is for people who never programmed before, but want to learn it at a
lower level. Low level in this context means close to hardware.  
  
The year at the time of writing this is 2024. C is now over 50 years old.  
"Sounds like it's outdated, so why would I want to learn C?" you might ask.  
C is not obsolete, despite its age.
Surely some use cases have mostly better alternatives, but not every.
Nowadays C is mostly used for embedded systems, games,
and operating system kernels such as Linux, the BSDs, and more.
More on language choice for real production comes later.  
  
C is our companion in this book for exactly two reasons:  

- It's a low level language, which means the code written by the
  developer is closer to the hardware, as opposed to Python code for example.
- It has a simplistic and minimal language design,
  making it ideal for beginners in the low level realm.

If you are interested in finding out how machines and software works,
the C language is a good choice.
Writing C can be simple, if you think like a computer.
It will not overwhelm a beginner with complicated features or restrictions
that are only important for real work, such as Rust's borrow checker.  
  
While the other mentioned languages are fine for production,
they are not good for teaching the fundamentals of programming,
especially in regards to the low level.
