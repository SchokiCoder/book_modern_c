# Foreword

This book is for people who never programmed before but want to learn it at a
lower level. Low-level in this context means close to hardware.  
  
The year at the time of writing this is 2022. C is now 50 years old. So why
would you want to learn C?  
Nowadays C is mostly used for embedded systems, games and operating systems such
as Linux, the BSD's and more.  
  
C is our companion in this book for exactly two reasons:  

- It being a low-level language, which means the actual code written by the
  developer is closer to the hardware as opposed to Python-Code for example.
- Simplistic and minimal language design, making it ideal for beginners in the
  low-level realm.

So if you are interested in finding out how machines and software works, the C
language is a good choice. Writing C can be simple, if you think like a
computer.  
It is not going to overwhelm you as a beginner with complicated concepts which
are only important for actual work and advanced developers, like Rust's borrow
checking for example.  
  
While other mentioned languages are fine and good for production, they are not
good for teaching programming and software basics especially in regards to
low-level.
