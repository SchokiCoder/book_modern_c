# Roads to Rome

In programming there is rarely one correct way to do it. Different people think
divergent and can come up with different and valid solutions. In the following
snippet are two functions that reverse a string. The interface and
implementation of those functions differs.  

```c
{{ #include ../code/21_roads-to-rome/string-reverse.c }}
```

Both are valid solutions to the problem.  
Though you should make sure to use the most simplistic solution whenever
possible. Sure comments help with complex situations but maintaining a simple
function is easier than maintaining a complex function.  
  
Never feel smug because you got a flashy solution.  
As a wise man once said:  
"An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity."
